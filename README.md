# Project_2-dod
Ucf Project 12-4-18 Developers for Data

##Description:

The purpose of the project -- a website -- is to get a picture of what a potential client needs and into what category they fall. 

Clients often come to a web development company without a clear idea -- or any idea -- of what they need. Do they need a website? An app? Are they selling something? What kind of server do they have? Through the website / app we are creating in this project, a client will be able to find the answers to these questions, and the web developer will know what services they need to provide.

This includes data flow, storage space, speed, and flexibility for growth.  Clients often come to a web development company without a clear idea -- or any idea -- of what they need.
